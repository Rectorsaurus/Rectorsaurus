# 👋 Hi, I'm @Rectorsaurus

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm a QA Engineer at Planning Center, where I've been making a difference for the "big C" Church since January 28, 2015. I started as a customer service agent and worked my way up to a Technical Support Manager before transitioning to my current role. My journey here has been an incredible 9.5 years, and I'm passionate about delivering top-notch quality assurance.

- 💻 **Current Role:** QA Engineer
- 💼 **Past Role:** Technical Support Manager

## 🌟 Hobbies & Interests
When I'm not working, you can find me enjoying a variety of hobbies and activities:

- 🏞️ **Outdoor Activities:** Hiking, camping, and exploring nature.
- 👨‍👦‍👦 **Family Time:** Playing with my three sons and making unforgettable memories.
- 🎶 **Music:** Listening to and playing music.
- 🌱 **Gardening:** Growing my own garden and enjoying the fruits (and veggies) of my labor.

## 🏡 Personal Projects
I'm currently building a barndominium in Odenville, AL, acting as the general contractor. The home is completely custom and features a steel structure with steel panels for the walls and roof, wood for interior framing, and red iron for all exterior wall structure framing. This project is a significant step towards my 5-year goal of becoming more self-sufficient and building my dream home.

## 🏍️ Other Interests
I'm also working on a 1999 Jeep Wrangler with a 2.5L engine, which has been a rewarding and hands-on project. Recently, I installed a new water pump, and hydraulic lifters to keep it running smoothly.

## 🎯 Future Goals
- **Travel:** Purchase a small Class A motor home and travel the country with my family.
- **Self-Sufficiency:** Continue working towards building a self-sufficient lifestyle.

## 🎓 Certifications
I'm currently taking an ISTQB certification course to further enhance my skills and knowledge in the QA field.
